For a week I was facing this error for the sensor we mounted on our titan. The potentionmeter that was mounted to read the angle for the steering wheel was not logging data.
For a week I struggled alot , then one night I ripped off all the circuit .
Resoldered it to check possible short circuits.
Then I found finally that arduino was logging data when connected to the usb for of my laptop , but when I connected the arduino to the battery it simply did't created any file or logged data.

  KEY OBSERVATIONS :
    I OBSERVED THAT THE GREEN LED AND THE LED AT PIN 13 GLOWED BRIGHT WHEN CONNECTED TO USB PORT.
    WHEREAS IF CONNECTED TO THE OLD 9V BATTERY WHICH IS USED OF THE WEEK , THE BOTH THE LED'S GLOW DIMMER, THIS HELPED ME TO RECOGNISE THE ERROR IN THE BATTERY VOLTAGE.
    
    SO I QUICKLY CHANGED THE BATTERY AND TTTTAAAAADDDDAAAA!!!!!!!
    THE ARDUINO STARTED LOGGING THE DATA AGAIN!!!!!
    
    THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ARDUINO  IF MOUNTED ON THE VEHICLE
